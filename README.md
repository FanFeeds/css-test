# Job Candidate Evaluation: CSS Layout
## Abstract
This is a CSS test designed to evaluate the skill a candidate posses with regard to CSS layout and appearance. It is not meant to test CSS3 capabilities or more advanced CSS. If the candidate can successfully complete the test within 30 minutes, she will be deemed skilled with regards to CSS layout.
## Task
Using the provided HTML and CSS files, create the layout that is pictured in [final.png](css-test/final.png)
## Guidelines
- The HTML markup may not be modified in any way
- At no time should search engines or other reference materials be used
- Margins, padding and white space do not need to be exact, but alignment of page elements should be pixel perfect
- Font sizes do not need to be exact but should be appropriately sized, relative to other font sizes used
- The finished layout must match the image relatively between window sizes 1024x800 and 1400x9000
- The finished layout should match image colors generally, but be consistent. An exact color match is unnecessary, however, understanding how to get a general color or shade using rgb() or HEX Codes is a part of this evaluation
- The finished layout should not use breakpoints
- Progress can be checked at any time with a browser refresh of the test html page.
